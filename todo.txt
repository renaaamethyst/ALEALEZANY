Another idea is to make a better functioning logic gates simulator. LIMITATIONS:
1. Multi-bit width wire, only have 32 bit.
2. SR latch, if you make any SR latch, or making any more memory, doesn't really work (one would have to manually reset).
3. Clock speed is very low.
4. Can't control color of a display.
5. Bug fixes (since it hasn't been updated in 10 years).
6. Doesn't handle large numbers of circuits very well.

HOW IT IS: Alex will look over all the files from the open source, make a list of the most important functions (besides GUI), and say whether or not is on a harder or easier spectrum. Teammates then choose a file/function to work on.
860 total files, dont need to be 1-1
IMPORTANT TO DO: Alex make a list of most important files to work on/be implemented.
Get list by Saturday.
